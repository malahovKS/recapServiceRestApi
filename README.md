##### Abstract.
Background. Creation of supporting complex applications for scientific research has always been the one of the key areas of computer science. The paper considers theoretical and practical aspects of developing advanced integrated knowledge-oriented information systems and their components.
##### Objective. 
Design and implementation of the software subsystem for creation and use of ontological knowledge base for research fellow’s publications with providing services such as indexing, storing, construckting and formalization of knowledge representation derived during the research and collective interaction.
##### Methods.
Analysis of the existing scientific information systems and the synthesis of the general principles for developing "The instrumental complex for scientific research workplace" and its components.
##### Results. 
Designed and developed functional components of knowledge-oriented information system developing "The instrumental complex for scientific research workplace", including functional models and software implementation of the software subsystem for creation and use of ontological knowledge base for research fellow’s publications, as part of personalized knowledge base of scientific researcher.
##### Conclusions. 
Research in modern conditions of e-Science paradigm requires pooling scientific community and intensive exchange of research results that may be achieved through the use of scientific information systems. "The instrumental complex for scientific research workplace" allows to solve problems of contructivization and formalization of knowledge reprezentation, obtained during the research process and collective accomplices interaction.
